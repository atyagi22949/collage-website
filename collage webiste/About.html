           <p>The purpose of an About Us page is to draw people’s attention and help them understand 
           who you are and what you have to offer. With the ‘About Us’ page, as an online instructor 
           you offer to students the opportunity to meet you by presenting some essential information
           about your personal and professional profile.<br>
           Apart from that, an About Us page also gives you the chance to establish a relationship with
           people you haven’t met yet, providing you with an extra competitive advantage over other
           course sellers who are promoting the same product, but fail to become well-known to the
           public.<br>
